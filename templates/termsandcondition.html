                            Refund Policy: <br>
                            Understand our refund policy's privileges and limitations as per the Professional
                            Ghostwriter Policy.

                            Entitled to a 50% refund before work commencement.
                            Post-order placement changes must be requested within one hour to avoid a 50% processing

                            Refunds, based on mutual agreement, are processed for significantly off-mark deliveries.

                            Commitment to timely delivery; however, delays proven to be our fault,
                            after three contact attempts, will lead to a refund. <br>
